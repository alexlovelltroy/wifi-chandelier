# wifi-chandelier
The Arduino code for my Neopixel/huzzah chandelier.

I have one RGBW Neopixel ring as one "strand" and four RGB Neopixel rings wired together as a second "strand".  They replace lightbulbs in a lamp.

I can control them with REST calls using the handy [aREST](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST) library.

A video of bootup and a loop of REST calls being process is available [on Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/PHNwMu)
